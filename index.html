                        <h1>What is Digital Art?</h1>
                            <p>Digital Art is an evolution of traditonal art, made on an electronic device. It allows you to save your work as an image file on your coputer. So what is this the difference between digital art and traditonal, and what makes it special? First off, art is not limited by just 2 types, it could be anything that you created. Digital art is just pieces of artwork made using softwares, computers, tablets, or other pieces of technology. Some examples would be: animations, photographs, or illustrations. </p>
                                <h2>What is the difference between digital art and traditonal art?</h2>
                                    <p>Traditional Art is what you would call artwork made from actual drawing supplies, like paper and pencil. There are many different medias, which gives artists a lot of options to choose from, and everyone has preferences. Traditional art pieces most of the time are worth more than digital ones mainly because of how it is difficult to change or alter aspects without using more supplies or potentially ruining the art. If you would like to have another copy, you would need a digital camera or a scanner to reproduce it, and it probably won't be able to capture its full quality. If you run out of art supplies, you must go and buy more, and due to the rarity of colors it could be very expensive.</p>
